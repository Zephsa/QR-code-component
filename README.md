## My process

I created HTML markup first to structure my content and then I started styling every piece at a time. I created mobile-view first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a GitHub repository, how to publish a project and how to ask for feedback. I also strengthened my knowledge of the CSS properties used in this project.

### Continued development

At first I wanted to use Bootstrap but then I felt overwhelmed and went for classic CSS, so I'd like to try and recreate it with Bootstrap.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - I consulted MDN for properties I didn't remember how to set (e.g. box-shadow).
- [Color convert](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hsl-to-rgb.html) - This helped me convert hsl value to rgb.
- [Submit guide](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) - Very useful to understand how to set up my GitHub and publish my project for the challenge.
